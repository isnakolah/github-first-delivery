# Operations

Store `GFD_WRITER_TOKEN` only as an Actions secret. For a personal Project V2, GitHub currently requires a dedicated classic PAT with `public_repo` and `project`; fine-grained PATs cannot mutate that Project. Classic PATs cannot be restricted to one public repository, so use a dedicated token with a short expiry, rotate and revoke it promptly, and never place it in config, cache, logs, request comments, or shell history. `gfd configure writer-token --apply` reads it from standard input without printing or persisting it locally.

For local commands, `gfd` uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` when supplied; otherwise it reads the active `gh auth token` credential in memory for that invocation. It never writes either credential to repository config or cache.

`authorized_actors` in `.github/gfd/config.yaml` is stable Writer authorization, initially repository owner only. Add a GitHub login through reviewed source change before that person or agent may submit a Writer request. Public Issue comments alone never authorize a mutation.

All changing commands require `--apply`; bootstrap requires `--yes`. `gfd context` is first command for agents. Claim leaf work before branch/edit. Submit evidence with final SHA, PR/CI URLs, commands, environments, acceptance result, artifacts, documentation, risks, and proof boundary. A merged PR alone is not Done.

`gfd init` creates Kind, Area, Priority, Proof, lease, branch, and fingerprint fields; replaces Project Status options with canonical lifecycle values; creates configured `area:*` labels; and persists resolved field IDs in `.github/gfd/config.yaml`. It is safe only for fresh bootstrap repositories.

It also installs source-controlled Epic, Work, Decision, and routed Issue forms plus the compact GitHub-first agent rule. Bootstrap refuses to overwrite any installed operating file.

`gfd validate --json` reads live GitHub Issues and Project fields. It reports every detected live-work violation: missing parent/contract/Project Status/Kind/Area, parent or blocker cycle, unresolved blocker in Ready/Claimed/In progress/Done, Epic branch ownership, field-label mismatch, and a Done parent with unfinished child. Closed historical Issues remain relationship context but do not require current Project classification.

Use `gfd context --issue-number N --json` to obtain Issue node ID and current state fingerprint. The Writer rejects a changed fingerprint. Claims also require `--branch NNN/short-description`; leases use a two-hour maximum. On an Issue-comment event, active Writer runs fingerprint verification, lifecycle validation, Project field update, then receipt emission. It never activates without `GFD_WRITER_TOKEN`.

`gfd writer reconcile --apply` scans every open Issue, replays unreceipted requests, and returns expired Claimed/In progress leases to Ready while retaining branch context. Scheduled Writer runs invoke it every five minutes. Reconciliation writes an expiry receipt only once.

On first active reconciliation, Writer fills blank Project Status (`Backlog`), Kind/Area from stable labels, Priority (`P2`), and Proof (`Not started`) without overwriting populated values. It adds `area:stable` only where legacy bootstrap Epics have no Area label, preserving field-label agreement.

Evidence is a Writer request, never a free-form completion comment. `gfd evidence submit` requires `--pr`, final SHA, CI URL, exact commands, environments, criteria result, artifacts (`None: reason` allowed), documentation impact, residual risks (`None` allowed), and proof boundary. Valid evidence moves only In review work to Evidence pending and is preserved in Writer receipt JSON.

`gfd pr link --issue-number N --issue-id ID --fingerprint SHA --pr URL --apply` records an open canonical PR request and moves only In progress work to In review. Evidence re-reads its PR and requires merged state plus exact merge-commit SHA match before any evidence state mutation.

Wiki journal is generated from receipts and is noncanonical. If Wiki write fails, Writer leaves work at Evidence pending and reconciliation retries.
